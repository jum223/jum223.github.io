## About Me 

Hello! I'm Juan Mozos Nieto, nice to meet you!

I am a senior from Spain who will be graduating in December 2023 from Lehigh University. I am currently pursuing a double major in Finance and Business Analytics, along with a minor in Financial Technology (FinTech). Within the finance sector, I am especially interested in how technological innovations are adopted and leveraged to improve efficiency. I am particularly intrigued by the potential impact of blockchain technology on the future of the finance industry and the business world. Additionally, I am keenly interested in how data can assist businesses in making informed decisions. My enthusiasm for these topics is reflected in my coursework, where, in addition to the standard finance courses, I have also taken financial data analytics and blockchain applications courses. I believe that staying informed about emerging trends and advancements in the field is essential for a successful career in finance, which is why I remain committed to keeping up with the latest developments in the industry.

_**[Analyzing the correlation between 10-K sentiment scores and post-filing stock returns](report/report.md)**_

The purpose of this project is to analyze the relationship between the performance of stocks for firms in the S&P500 index and the sentiment of their respective 10-K filings. Two different post 10-K release return variables are computed and their relationship against various sentiment variables pertaining to 10-K data is analyzed. A hypothesis on the expected correlations between these variables is first formulated, and after some analysis I end up contradicting my initial hypothesis. Shortly put, the more negative the sentiment scores the better the firm's stock performance is. For further details about the purpose of the project, the data being used, and the process of data creation please refer to the link above.

_**[Analyzing Bank of the West Lending Practices](https://ledatascifi.github.io/FinTech-Capstone-2023/)**_

Government regulations today prevent financial institutions from making lending decisions based on an applicant's demographic attributes. Historically, the practice of redlining prevented residents of certain areas from accessing credit due to race or ethnicity. Our mission on this project was to identify whether or not Bank of the West violates fair lending requirements by conducting a thorough analysis of its lending behaviors in areas with high minority populations. To see the full report, our analysis, methodologies and findings please see the [project's website](https://ledatascifi.github.io/FinTech-Capstone-2023/).

_**[Analyzing the Effect on Stock Returns That the Russo-Ukrainian Armed Conflict Has Had on Energy, Metal, Semiconductor, Transport, and Food Industries](https://russiaukrainewarindustryreturns.streamlit.app)**_

The main goal of this project is to explore how different industries are affected by the Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict that started on the 24th of February of 2022. In order to do so, we analyzed how different industries' returns were affected by a number of major events throughout the course of the war. We used a total of 17 major events and saw how cumulative returns for 5 industries, namely metal, energy, semiconductors, food, and transport industries, changed. In order to perform our analysis we used line-plots and computed return differences between the event date, 3 days after the event and 10 days after the event.

To see and interact with the visualizations we based our analysis on, please visit the [home page](https://russiaukrainewarindustryreturns.streamlit.app) of our dashboard. This page will allow you to select a number industries at a time (or all of them) and events based on their description which will then output a line graph based on the desired industry and event choices.

For further details on the data we used to produce the visualization, the methodologies used to produce the code that produces the visualizations, our findings and the conclusions we reached please visit our dashboard's [report section](https://russiaukrainewarindustryreturns.streamlit.app).

_**[Bankruptcy Prediction for Taiwanese Companies](/pdf/BUAN352_Project_Report.pdf)**_

The purpose of this project was to use ML (Machine Learning) techniques, such as multiple linear regression or classificaction and regression trees (CART),  to predict the probability of a given company going bankrupt. In order to do so, we used their financial data and were able to discover which are the most significant indicators of bankruptcy probability. For further details on the methodology, process, and data used please visit the link of the report above.
