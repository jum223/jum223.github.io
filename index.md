## About Me 

Hello! I'm Juan Mozos Nieto, nice to meet you!

I am a senior from Spain who will be graduating in December 2023 from Lehigh University. I am currenlty pursuing a double major in Finance and Business Analyitics and a minor in Financial Technology (FinTech). My hobbies are playing and watching soccer, skiing, and spending quality time with friends and family. Within the Finance sector, I am especially interested in how technological innovations are adopted and leveraged to improve its efficiency. I am particularly intrigued by the potential impact of blockchain technology on the future of the finance industry and the business world. Additionally, I am keenly interested in how data can help businesses make informed decisions. My enthusiasm for these topics is reflected in my coursework; where apart from the standard finance courses, I have taken financial data analytics courses and blockchain applications courses. I believe that staying informed about emerging trends and advancements in the field is essential for a successful career in finance, which is why I remain committed to keeping up with the latest developments in the industry.

_**[Analyzing the correlation between 10-K sentiment scores and post-filing stock returns](report/report.md)**_

The purpose of this project is to analyze the relationship between the performance of stocks for firms in the S&P500 index and the sentiment of their respective 10-K filings. Two different post 10-K release return variables are computed and their relationship against various sentiment variables pertaining to 10-K data is analyzed. A hypothesis on the expected correlations between these variables is first formulated, and after some analysis I end up contradicting my initial hypothesis. Shortly put, the more negative the sentiment scores the better the firm's stock performance is. For further details about the purpose of the project, the data being used, and the process of data creation please refer to the link above.
